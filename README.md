# CRISPREfficiencyPredictor
A multi-stage deep learning project focused on predicting CRISPR guide efficiency using real experimental data. This repository documents each development step from preprocessing to model evaluation, building toward a cleaner, multi-feature architecture that integrates sequence, PAM, and biological context for improved accuracy.
